SQL Schema
Table: Students

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
 

Table: Subjects

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
subject_name is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name of one subject in the school.
 

Table: Examinations

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.
Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
 

Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

Explanation: 
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
Alex did not attend any exams.
John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.

// Approach : Using commom table expression
WITH Students_Info as(
    SELECT * FROM Students
    CROSS JOIN Subjects
), Cte as(
    SELECT student_id, subject_name, COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM Examinations 
    GROUP BY student_id, subject_name
)

SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, s.subject_name, CASE WHEN c.cnt IS NOT NULL THEN c.cnt ELSE 0 END as attended_exams 
FROM Students_Info s LEFT JOIN Cte c
ON (s.student_id = c.student_id AND s.subject_name=c.subject_name) 
ORDER BY s.student_id, s.subject_name
