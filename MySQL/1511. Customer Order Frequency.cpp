// Approach : Using common table expression
WITH cte1 as(
    SELECT o.customer_id, YEAR(o.order_date) as year, MONTH(o.order_date) as month, SUM(o.quantity*p.price) as spent_amount
    FROM Orders o 
    LEFT JOIN Product p ON (o.product_id=p.product_id) WHERE (YEAR(o.order_date)='2020' AND (MONTH(o.order_date)) IN (6,7))
    GROUP BY o.customer_id, YEAR(o.order_date), MONTH(o.order_date)
), cte2 as(
    SELECT customer_id FROM cte1
    WHERE spent_amount>=100
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(Month)=2
)

SELECT c.customer_id, cu.name
FROM cte2 c LEFT JOIN Customers cu 
ON (c.customer_id = cu.customer_id)
