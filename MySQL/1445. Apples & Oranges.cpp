(sale_date, fruit) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
 
Write an SQL query to report the difference between the number of apples and oranges sold each day.
Return the result table ordered by sale_date

Input: 
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |

Explanation: 
Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).

// Approach 1: Using Common Table Expression
WITH cte1 as(
    SELECT *
    FROM Sales
    ORDER BY sale_date, fruit
), cte2 as(
    SELECT sale_date, sold_num as apple_cnt, LEAD(sold_num,1) OVER (PARTITION BY sale_date) as orange_cnt
    FROM cte1
)
SELECT sale_date, (apple_cnt-orange_cnt) as diff
FROM cte2
WHERE orange_cnt IS NOT NULL

// Approach 2: 
SELECT sale_date, SUM(CASE WHEN fruit='apples' THEN sold_num ELSE -sold_num END) as diff
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sale_date
