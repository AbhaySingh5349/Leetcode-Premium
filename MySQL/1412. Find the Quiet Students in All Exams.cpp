SQL Schema
Table: Student

+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
 

Table: Exam

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the student with student_id had a score points in the exam with id exam_id.
 
A quiet student is the one who took at least one exam and did not score the high or the low score.
Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being quiet in all exams. Do not return the student who has never taken any exam.

Input: 
Student table:

Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |

| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |

Explanation: 
For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exams.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.

// Approach : Using commom table expression
WITH cte1 as(
    SELECT exam_id, MIN(score) as score
    FROM Exam 
    GROUP BY exam_id
    
    UNION
    
    SELECT exam_id, MAX(score) as score
    FROM Exam 
    GROUP BY exam_id
), cte2 as(
    SELECT student_id
    FROM Exam e
    GROUP BY student_id
    HAVING SUM((e.exam_id, e.score) IN (SELECT c.exam_id, c.score FROM cte1 c))=0 
)

SELECT * FROM Student WHERE student_id IN (SELECT * FROM cte2)
